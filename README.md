Magnetic Levitation System Control
This document represents the process of controlling the Magnetic Levitation system. In the first part, 
the dynamic equations of systems are derived and linearized. The state-space representation of the system is obtained 
from the linearized equations and the system is implemented in MATLAB. One controller is designed in each 
modern control theory approach and classical control theory approach. The results of designing the controller are 
used to compare these two approaches and to verify the advantages and disadvantages of each over the other one.
